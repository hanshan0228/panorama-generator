  {
    question: 'How do I generate a 360° panorama?',
    answer:
      'Type a scene description in natural English (or attach up to 3 reference photos to steer style and lighting), select a resolution tier (1K, 2K, or 4K), and click Generate. The pipeline automatically constructs the cylindrical wrap, executes symmetric seam healing, and renders the result directly in the built-in 360° WebGL sphere viewer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does each panorama take to generate?',
    answer:
      'In Instant Procedural mode, generation is completed in under 500 milliseconds. When utilizing connected AI image models (such as Gemini 2.5/3.1 or local 8317 proxy endpoints), high-resolution generation typically takes between 8 and 25 seconds, with real-time step progress displayed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What format is the output file?',
    answer:
      'Standard output is a 2:1 equirectangular PNG image (1024×512, 2048×1024, or 3840×1920). You can also download Radiance .hdr files for 3D IBL pipelines, or export 6-sided cubemap ZIP archives (Right, Left, Top, Bottom, Front, Back) ready for Unity Skybox.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does the 360° viewer work on mobile devices and VR headsets?',
    answer:
      'Yes. The embedded Three.js WebGL viewer is fully responsive on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and Meta Quest Oculus Browser. On smartphones, you can pan with your finger or toggle the Cardboard Split-Screen VR mode for dual-eye immersive viewing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use the generated panoramas for commercial projects?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Outputs generated with paid credits (Pro or Enterprise plans) include full commercial usage rights for video games, architectural visualization, advertising, VR experiences, and client commissions. Free explorer outputs are licensed for personal evaluation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the credit-based pricing system work?',
    answer:
      'Every new account receives 50 free credits to test the generator and viewers. 1K generation debits 3 credits, 2K HD debits 6 credits, and 4K Ultra HD debits 12 credits. Pro subscriptions start at $9.9/month (annual billing) or $19/month for 1,000 monthly credits.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between text-to-panorama and image-to-panorama?",
    answer:
      'Text-to-panorama generates an entire spherical scene purely from your text prompt. Image-to-panorama allows you to attach 1 to 3 reference photos to guide the color palette, lighting atmosphere, and architectural materials, while the model fills out the remaining 360-degree environment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use these AI panoramas in Blender, Unreal Engine, or Unity?',
    answer:
      'Yes. The 2:1 PNG drops directly into Blender as an Environment Texture (World Shader), into Unreal Engine 5 as an HDRIBackdrop or Skylight, and into Unity as a Skybox Panoramic material. The .hdr export wraps the luminance data into a standard Radiance container for seamless IBL lighting.',
